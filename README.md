## About
This is a theme designed to be lightweight and simple, preserving the orginal look of discord while adding new graphical effects and a smoother colour pallet. With perfomance as the primary goal, this theme should not impact your discord speed while improving the experience.

This theme uses the [catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) Macchiato colour pallet. 

If you do decide to change/add anything (and you want to share), make a pull request ideally or make a issue if there is a bug somewhere.
